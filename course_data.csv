2024-01-06T02:52:06.873746,ENG EC 327,Introduction to Software Engineering,"Prereq: ENG EK 125 . This course aims to introduce students to software design, programming techniques, data structures, and software engineering principles. The course is structured bottom up, beginning with basic hardware followed by an understanding of machine language that controls the hardware and the assembly language that organizes that control. It then proceeds through fundamental elements of functional programming languages, using C as the case example, and continues with the principles of object-oriented programming, as principally embodied in C++ but also its daughter languages Java, C#, and objective C. The course will conclude with an introduction to elementary data structures and algorithmic analysis. Throughout, the course develops core competencies in software engineering, including programming style, optimization, debugging, compilation, and program management, utilizing a variety of Integrated Development Environments and operating systems.",N/A,4 cr.,https://www.bu.edu/phpbin/course-search/search.php?page=w0&pagesize=-1&adv=1&nolog=&search_adv_all=ENG+EC+327&yearsem_adv=2024-SPRG&credits=*&pathway=&hub_match=all
2024-01-06T02:52:15.712896,ENG EK 131,Introduction to Engineering: Hands On,"Prereq: Freshman standing or consent of instructor This course introduces freshmen to a set of design-oriented engineering skills through a hands-on experience using engineering tools (software and hardware) for design and prototyping. Students will be exposed to a number of mechanical and electrical engineering tools applicable to 3D visualization, building structures, designing and wiring circuits, prototyping and instrumentation. Students will work individually and in teams to build substructures that can be integrated into a functional device (final product).",N/A,2 cr.,https://www.bu.edu/phpbin/course-search/search.php?page=w0&pagesize=-1&adv=1&nolog=&search_adv_all=ENG+EK+131&yearsem_adv=2024-SPRG&credits=*&pathway=&hub_match=all
2024-01-06T03:13:03.309603,SAR HS 325,Introduction to Global Health,"This course will provide students with an overview of the complex social, economic, political, environmental, and biological factors that structure the origins, consequences, and possible treatments of illness worldwide, as well as the promotion of health. Students will learn about the major themes and concepts shaping the interdisciplinary field of global health, and will gain an understanding of solutions to health challenges that have been successfully implemented in different parts of the world.
